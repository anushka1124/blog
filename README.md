# Blog Website with React and AppContext

Welcome to my blog website! This project showcases a simple blog website built using React and `AppContext` for managing the state. The website allows users to read various blog posts. The project demonstrates how to fetch and display blog posts using React components and context.

## Features

- Display a list of blog posts fetched from an API.
- Implement pagination to navigate through blog posts.
- Use `AppContext` to manage the application's state and share data between components.
